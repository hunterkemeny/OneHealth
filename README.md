OneHealth is an all-encompassing health app that suggests personalized daily workouts and meal plans to meet your weight goal and provides the most up to date articles/podcasts/videos on nutrition science and longevity. Clone to download:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hunterkemeny/OneHealth.git
```

## About
OneHealth provides the following functions:

1. Inform the user of everything they can do to optimize their health and longevity.
2. Keep the user up-to-date on the newest health science so they can optimize their routine based on the best data.
3. Track biometric data with Apple Watch HealthKit so that the user doesn't have to estimate the number calories burned per exercise.
4. Imports diet data from MyFitnessPal so the user doesn't have to manually find the number of calories per meal.
5. Provide the user with daily exercises and calorie goals to help them meet their weight goal (meaning the user doesn't have to plan exercises or calculate calories, two huge barriers for many people when attempting to become healthier).
6. Notify the user when they should drink water, meditate, begin eating, end eating, workout, etc. so that they stay on a consistent schedule.
7. Track and display user data v. time so that the user can easily see their progress; displays calorie intake and calories burned with their weight so they can visualize how exercising and dieting has directly impacted their health.
8. Built-in calendar so that the user can access their historically logged data.

### Notes
You must have an Apple Watch to use the app. If you do not have an Apple Watch, your app will display an error message.
